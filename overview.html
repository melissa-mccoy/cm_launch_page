                    <p class="text-left">Doctors are often only available during work hours & urban sprawl+heavy traffic can make a trip to the doctor take the entire day. Charl, a business consultant in Johannesburg, complained it took her over 4 hours to see his primary care physician just to get a specialist referral. Elani, a working mother, said, while it sometimes proves unnecessary, she misses work & takes her newborn to the doctor for all his ailments, wanting to be sure nothing serious is missed. She's starting to think it might be impossible to continue working and care for her children.</p>

And the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.XPD.PCAP?page=1">World Bank shows</a> that per capita health expenditure has more than doubled since 2000. This is making quality healthcare increasingly unattainable for South Africa's rising middle class. Because of our minimal overhead costs, we are able to pay doctors private care salaries but charge patients significantly less.

                     <p class="text-left">There are several health issues that patients find difficult to share with friends & family and wish not to discuss with their family doctors. This unfortunately leaves many people without proper care & treatment for their ailments such as:</p>
                    <ul class="text-left">
                        <li><strong>Mental Health Issues:</strong> A<a href="http://www.ijmhs.com/content/5/1/8"> Mental Health and Poverty Research Program study</a> found that 16.5% of South African adults suffer from mental illness. For fear of social ostracism, many keep their mental illness secret instead of seeking the much needed medical attention.
                        <li><strong>Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) & HIV/AIDs: </strong> According to the <a href="http://www.doh.gov.za/">Department of Health</a>, widespread lack of knowledge, resistance, or popular misconceptions regarding STDs are a huge reason why they remain a major health problem. Less than 20% have received sexual education by age 18.
                        <li><strong>Sexual Violence: </strong>The rate of sexual violence in South Africa is among the highest in the world. According to the <a href="http://www.mrc.ac.za/">South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC)</a> in a <a href="http://www.irinnews.org/report/84909/south-africa-one-in-four-men-rape"> 2009 study</a>, over 40% of South African women are raped at least once in their lifetimes but only 1 in 9 are reported. Women often don't know where to turn for healthcare related to such incidents.</li>
                    </ul>
                     <p class="text-left">Our patients can choose to turn video off and not disclose their name to feel safe when discussing their issues with or seeking a specialist referral from one of our doctors.</p>

                    </span>
                    <h4 class="problem-heading">Scarce</h4>
                    <p class="text-left">There are not enough doctors to meet demand. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in South Africa, there are only 0.77 doctors for every thousand people, compared with an average of 3.5 in developed countries and over two-thirds of existing doctors live in urban areas. There are several ways that our video consultations can help this issue:</p>
                    <ul class="text-left">
                        <li><strong>Captures Doctor Idle Time:</strong> 73% of private sector doctors surveyed said they often have openings in their day - perhaps there's a 30min break between patients or a patient has canceled. This "idle" doctor time can be captured by our platform as doctors can just jump online whenever they're free and serve patients who are in need.</li>
                        <li><strong>Captures Doctor Good Will:</strong> 45% of urban doctors surveyed said they would provide consultations to rural patients at a discounted rate as a form of giving back, but only 3% would if they had to travel to the rural location. This desire to serve can be captured by our platform and provide more resources to rural patients.</li>
                        <li><strong>Makes Public Sector More Attractive:</strong> 65% of public sector doctors said they'd like to serve on the platform in off hours to earn extra money. Perhaps more doctors would serve in the public sector knowing they have this additionally income option?</li>

                                    <p id="cold" class="collapse indent">Upper respiratory infections are the broad category for flu, sinus infections, bronchitis, runny noses, coughs and colds. These common conditions can often be diagnosed through ConnectMed, keeping you out of the doctor’s office and away from unnecessary germs.</p>

                                    <p id="throat" class="collapse indent">A sore throat is a very common symptom which could be an indicator of a series of ailments, including many that can often be treated via our video consultations. It can be difficult for a patient to know if they have a Cold, Allergies, Strep Throat, or Tonsillitis unless they visit with a doctor. Our doctors are trained to evaluate your symptoms and, depending on the clinical circumstances, diagnose and treat the various causes of a sore throat specifically through a video visit.</p>
                                <a class="list-group-item" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#uti"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> Urinary Tract Infections</a>
                                    <p id="uti" class="collapse indent">Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a very common condition. In fact, more often than not, when patients come to a doctor they have already experienced the symptoms and have been diagnosed with this condition before. While physicians will sometimes order a urinalysis, in many cases a urinalysis is not necessary to make a diagnosis. Either way, the physician may want to begin treatment before the urinalysis results come back. This is because a urine culture can take 48 hours before it starts growing any bacteria.</p>
                                <a class="list-group-item" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#injuries"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> Minor Injuries</a>
                                    <p id="injuries" class="collapse indent">Sports and exercise activities are an important part of any healthy lifestyle. But with increased activity comes the increased risk of injury. In the absence of an obviously severe injury like a broken bone, most doctor’s visits concerning sports injuries are patients looking for reassurance that the injury is not more severe. Sports injuries often fall into either a minor category (ankle sprains, wrist sprains, shoulder or rib soreness) or a severe category (broken bone, severely torn ligament/tendon).</p>
                                <a class="list-group-item" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#skin"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> Skin Conditions</a>
                                    <p id="skin" class="collapse indent">Common conditions include rashes, STDs, poison ivy, insect bites, cold sores, psoriasis, bites, contact dermatitis, scrapes, allergies, hives, sores and boils.These conditions are most often diagnosable by visual inspection. An important component of dermatological assessment is recognizing patterns, features, signs and symptoms. Using your computer camera through our platform, you can upload multiple photos safely and directly to your physician who can also store them to assess changes over time. The photos are transmitted with lossless compression giving your doctor a precise view of the tissue.</p>

                                <p id="diarrhea" class="collapse indent">Diagnosing the cause and determining appropriate treatment of diarrhea typically begins with very focused clinical questions. Your physician may recommend a special diet, over the counter and/or prescription medications, or follow-up care. Our doctor are often able to determine the cause and provide treatment for vomiting during a video consultation by reviewing your medical history, asking questions, and performing an exam.</p>
                            <a class="list-group-item" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#eye"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> Eye Conditions</a>
                                <p id="eye" class="collapse indent">Having an issue with one or both eyes can significantly and severely impact a patient’s lifestyle, causing not only pain but the inability to carry out necessary tasks. There are three basic categories: minor issues, moderate issues that require interim care followed by specialist care, and severe issues. Diagnosing the condition and severity often begins with questions about pain, discharge and previous eye damage, and the collection of a patient’s medical history. Then on camera, the physician can have the patient do several eye maneuvers and ask for still photographs to fully assess the eye. </p>

Therefore, we are in discussions with partner organizations who can provide the connectivity & infrastructure needed through "healthcare hubs".</p>
                    <h5><br>Optimized Technology</h5>
                    <p>While our web platform has already been designed with low bandwidth, low computationally powerful machines, and data cost sensitivity optimizations, we are working on further improving this functionality. Additionally we are developing a native Android application given the majority of lower income households have connectivity via mobile phones.</p>

This group earns 65% of total income, comprises 20% of the population, and is interested in using telemedicine (over 70% confirmed this in our market surveys).</p>

                    <p>Expansion to other African countries with substantial LSM 7-10 populations like Nigeria and Kenya will naturally follow at least a year after establishing a robust and replicable model in South Africa. Entry into non-Anglophone Africa will also be kicked off with entry into Senegal. The market potential for the continent is over $6 billion and given South Africa's prominence, adoption here will likely mean smooth adoption elsewhere.</p>
