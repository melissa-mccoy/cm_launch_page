                    <p>Our doctors can diagnose over 30 common ailments ranging from cold & flu to urintary tract infections. Our liability analysis and discussions with South African medical bodies also confirms that video-based diagnosis is acceptable to the system, just as it is in the US & UK.</p>

                                    <p id="cold" class="collapse indent">Upper respiratory infections are the broad category for flu, sinus infections, bronchitis, runny noses, coughs and colds. These common conditions can often be diagnosed through ConnectMed, keeping you out of the doctor’s office and away from unnecessary germs.</p>
                                  <a class="list-group-item" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#throat"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> Sore Throat</a>
                                    <p id="throat" class="collapse indent">A sore throat is a very common symptom which could be an indicator of a series of ailments, including many that can often be treated via our video consultations. It can be difficult for a patient to know if they have a Cold, Allergies, Strep Throat, or Tonsillitis unless they visit with a doctor. Our doctors are trained to evaluate your symptoms and, depending on the clinical circumstances, diagnose and treat the various causes of a sore throat specifically through a video visit.</p>
                                <a class="list-group-item" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#uti"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> Urinary Tract Infections</a>
                                    <p id="uti" class="collapse indent">Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a very common condition. In fact, more often than not, when patients come to a doctor they have already experienced the symptoms and have been diagnosed with this condition before. While physicians will sometimes order a urinalysis, in many cases a urinalysis is not necessary to make a diagnosis. Either way, the physician may want to begin treatment before the urinalysis results come back. This is because a urine culture can take 48 hours before it starts growing any bacteria.</p>

                                    <p id="injuries" class="collapse indent">Sports and exercise activities are an important part of any healthy lifestyle. But with increased activity comes the increased risk of injury. In the absence of an obviously severe injury like a broken bone, most doctor’s visits concerning sports injuries are patients looking for reassurance that the injury is not more severe. Sports injuries often fall into either a minor category (ankle sprains, wrist sprains, shoulder or rib soreness) or a severe category (broken bone, severely torn ligament/tendon).</p>
                                <a class="list-group-item" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#skin"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></span> Skin Conditions</a>
                                    <p id="skin" class="collapse indent">Common conditions include rashes, STDs, poison ivy, insect bites, cold sores, psoriasis, bites, contact dermatitis, scrapes, allergies, hives, sores and boils.These conditions are most often diagnosable by visual inspection. An important component of dermatological assessment is recognizing patterns, features, signs and symptoms. Using your computer camera through our platform, you can upload multiple photos safely and directly to your physician who can also store them to assess changes over time. The photos are transmitted with lossless compression giving your doctor a precise view of the tissue.</p>

                                <p id="diarrhea" class="collapse indent">Diagnosing the cause and determining appropriate treatment of diarrhea typically begins with very focused clinical questions. Your physician may recommend a special diet, over the counter and/or prescription medications, or follow-up care. Our doctor are often able to determine the cause and provide treatment for vomiting during a video consultation by reviewing your medical history, asking questions, and performing an exam.</p>

                                <p id="eye" class="collapse indent">Having an issue with one or both eyes can significantly and severely impact a patient’s lifestyle, causing not only pain but the inability to carry out necessary tasks. There are three basic categories: minor issues, moderate issues that require interim care followed by specialist care, and severe issues. Diagnosing the condition and severity often begins with questions about pain, discharge and previous eye damage, and the collection of a patient’s medical history. Then on camera, the physician can have the patient do several eye maneuvers and ask for still photographs to fully assess the eye. </p>

On-the-ground experience along with discussions with government and NGOs will inform our strategy for reaching lower income populations which will be planned slowly & carefully.</p>

                    <p>Expansion to other African countries with substantial LSM 7-10 populations like Nigeria, Kenya, and Ghana will naturally follow and you can see the market potential for the continent is over $6 billion. Given South Africa has one of the most well-respected medical systems on the continent, adoption here will mean smooth adoption elsewhere.</p>

                            <p>We're developing a patient-facing application that advises you on if and how urgently you need medical care based on your symptoms and history (a.k.a non-emergency triage). We've used UK patient data for initial training of the machine learning model but the algorithm will further be trained on South African patient data produced from our platform, making it even more accurate for the local context.</p>

This will allow our doctors to use your vital sign information during your video consultation and better diagnose you. We will likely also create a patient-facing tool that will allow you to take your vital signs for your own interest.</p>

                            <p class="item-intro text-muted">Our platform's data enables us to create highly accurate machine learning-based medical tools.</p>
                            <p>While digitized patient data is generally hard to come by, digitized South African and African patient data is virtually non-existant given the lack of electronic medical record systems. This is where our platform shows tremendous value - it collects & anonymizes patient symptom and diagnosis information which can be used to develop a multitude of machine learninb-based medical tools that are highly accurate and catered to the local context. Apart from our ConnectMed Symptom Checker and Vital Sign Detector, we have three other tools in development with many more to come.</p>
